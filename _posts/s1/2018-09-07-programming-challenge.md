### Grading ###

 <!--- - **Concours UCAnCODE** (40%): you will participate to a local programming contest. Your grade will depend on your rank in the contest. -->
- **Homework with Sphere Engine** (40%): there will be two problems sets over the course of the semester. Pair work is allowed.
  - [STAR](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=d82S0aO7SN)
  - [CINEMA](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=FEDuAqUZCK)
- **Final Exam** (60%): there will be two final exams of 3 hours, on a computer, where you will be asked to solve one problem each.
  - Look at the timetable where the time slots are given.
  
First, you must masterize the [tutorial]({% post_url ucancode/2019-07-22-tutoriel %}).

##### Instructions for submitting your homework
- Fill the problem form with your student email adresse.
- For pair work, give your two email adresses as a comment in the file header.

Beware that penalties will be given if you do not follow the above instructions.
